# **Homework-1-Code-Refactor**

Horiseon requested that their website codebase be refactored to follow accessibility standards and to be optimized for search engines.

## **Issues Addressed**

*The **HTML** was reformatted and commented to increase readability.
*The page contained three internal links at the top of the page to take the user to the corresponding section of the page. One of the links was non-functioning and was fixed by adding an **id** attribute.
*Numerous **div** tags were replaced by the appropriate semantic tags.

*The **CSS** was reformatted to reduce reduncdancy.
*Comments were added in the **CSS** to aid in identifying what was being styled and to aid in readability.
